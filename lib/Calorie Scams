Introduction:

What is a Calorie?

Start with a clear, simple definition: "A calorie is a unit of energy that measures the amount of energy food provides to our bodies."
Briefly mention its origin and why it's used to quantify food energy.
Caloric Counting vs. Metabolic Health:

Introduce the concept of metabolic health: "Metabolic health refers to how well our body processes and uses nutrients from the foods we eat."
Explain why calorie counting is insufficient: "Not all calories are created equal. The type, quality, and source of calories matter more than the number alone."
Provide examples: "100 calories from almonds affect our bodies differently than 100 calories from soda."
Transition:

Introduce the main thesis: "Despite the simplicity of calorie counting, it fails to capture the complexity of how food impacts our metabolic health. Yet, food companies exploit this oversimplification to their advantage."

Body:

The Deceptive Nature of Caloric Counting:
Explain how the calorie became a dietary focus: "In the early 20th century, the calorie became a popular metric for dieting and health."
Discuss why this approach is flawed: "Calorie counting ignores nutritional content and how different foods affect our bodies differently."
Transition:

Link to food industry practices: "This oversimplification has paved the way for food companies to mislead consumers under the guise of calorie control."

Food Industry Tactics:

Hidden Ingredients:
Explain how companies hide unhealthy ingredients: "Many processed foods contain hidden sugars, unhealthy fats, and artificial additives."
Provide examples: "Breakfast cereals, often marketed to children, can contain more sugar than a candy bar."
Transition:

Discuss how these hidden ingredients contribute to addictive eating patterns: "Beyond hiding ingredients, food companies enhance their products' addictive qualities."

Addictive Additives:
Discuss the science behind food addiction: "Certain ingredients, like sugar and high fructose corn syrup, trigger reward centers in the brain."
Provide examples of how this works: "Just like drugs, these ingredients can make us crave more, leading to overconsumption."
Transition:

Highlight how marketing plays into this deception: "To compound the issue, food companies use clever marketing strategies to disguise unhealthy products as healthy."

Marketing Strategies:
Describe misleading marketing tactics: "Terms like 'low-fat', 'sugar-free', and 'natural' are often used to make processed foods appear healthier."
Provide examples: "A 'low-fat' product might be loaded with sugar to improve taste."
Transition:

Tie these tactics to the food industry's primary goal: "Ultimately, these tactics serve one purpose: maximizing profit, often at the expense of public health."

Profit Over Public Health:
Explain the profit motive: "The food industry's primary goal is to increase profits, not to promote health."
Provide case studies: "Fast food chains have a history of marketing unhealthy foods to children, contributing to rising obesity rates."
Discuss the public health impact: "The prevalence of junk food is linked to increasing rates of obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic diseases."
Conclusion:

Consumer Awareness and Action:

Emphasize the importance of being informed: "As consumers, we need to be vigilant about what we put in our bodies."
Provide practical tips: "Read labels carefully, avoid highly processed foods, and choose whole, nutrient-dense options."
Call to Action:

Encourage proactive choices: "We must demand better from the food industry and prioritize our health over convenience."
Advocate for change: "Support policies that promote transparency and better nutritional standards."
Transition:

Summarize the main points: "By understanding the tricks food companies use and making informed choices, we can protect our metabolic health and push for a healthier future."

If a calorie were a calorie and if glucose and fructose were the same then you say well you get your calories somewhere but because fructose is not glucose because fructose toxicity has nothing to do its calories that is a huge overdose and it has metabolic complications, systemic health complication, mental health complications and ultimately societal complications. 

glucose causes small vessels to be dysfunctional, causes endothelial cell dysfunction. it causes high blood pressure because it causes small vessels to constrict. It interferes with nitric oxide (one of the things that relaxes the blood vessel) and it will basically reduce blood flow to specific organs. So high glucose is not good for you and it's bad for small vessel disease. That's why diabetics get retinopathy, nephropathy, kidney disease and nerve damage. 

Insulin is also bad. it's a growth factor. it causes vascular smooth muscle growth like in your coronary arteries. Primary drivers of heart disease and cancer. 

So glucose cause microvascular disease where as insulin causes macro vascular  disease. 

Kill calorie as a unit of measure. it has no place in our dialogue. it has no place in medicine. if you take a mole of glucose and you throw it into a bomb calorimeter, you will calories per gram of glucose. 

Calorie is a the amount of heat required to raise one gram of water in celsius. So, it's a measure of heat. Humans do burning in little organelle of each of our cells called mitochondria. if your mitochondria works efficiently, you can burn energy to completion and capture that energy in the form of chemical energy in your cell called ATP, which our cells uses to power all of the functions that the cell needs. Now glucose is good in a way that it stimulate mitochondria to work better. It stimulates two enzymes necessary for mitochondria to work. It stimulates an enzyme called AMP-kinase, makes more mitochondria and hydroxyacyl-CoA Dehydrogenase which is necessary to cleave two carbon fragments and oxide them for energy. Fructose on the other hand inhibits AMP kinase, cap1 carnitine pidol etc. Net effect is to inhibit mitochondrial function. So does fructose constitute energy if fructose is actually keeping you from making chemical energy in your cell? What do you mean by energy? If you talking about heat fructose is energy. if you are talking about ATP, fructose inhibits ATP. This is what we are talking about. This lead to systemic health problems.
