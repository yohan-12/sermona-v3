## Calorie Scam: How Food Companies Profit at the Expense of Your Metabolic Health. 

The food industry has mastered the art of "calories in, calories out."

They claim as long as you burn off calories through exercise, you're good. But let's be real, eating 100 calories of Krispy Kreme and 100 calories of an apple affects your body very differently. 

If you want to live a healthy life, you need to stop obsessing over calories and start focusing on food quality. 

### The Real Deal with Calories
A calorie is just a unit of energy. 

More precisely, it's the heat energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius. But our metabolism is way more complicated than that. 

When we eat, food starts breaking down in our mouth and continues in the small intestine, where it's absorbed into our bloodstream. Once in the bloodstream, these molecules are transported into our cells where mitochondria will start producing ATP. 

For example, 100 calories from a Krispy Kreme donut turn into glucose quickly, causing blood sugar spikes and triggering insulin. Repeated glucose spikes can lead to insulin resistance and make our blood vessels stiff, contributing to diabetes. In contrast, 100 calories from an apple are digested more slowly because of the fiber, which prevents glucose spikes and provides antioxidants that fight free radicals.
